## Prerequisites
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
 
 ## Getting Started
 - Clone the repository first.
 
       git clone https://github.com/shradha001/nodejs-boilerplate.git
- Change directory
`cd nodejs-boilerplate`

- Install dependencies
`npm install`

- Next, create a `.env` file in the root directory.
`nano .env`

- Add the database, JWT and Session configurations.
`JWT_SECRET=thisisasecret
SESSION_SECRET=thisissessionsecret
DB_NAME=yourdbname`
You can also change these configuration in `config/` directory. Checkout `.env.sample` file.

- Run the application in dev mode
`npm run dev`

## Testing the API in Swagger

 1. Once your application is up, open the url [http://localhost:9596/documentation/](http://localhost:9596/documentation/) in browser to access the swagger documentation. 
 2. Try out the `/users/register`API with a valid email and a password. Copy the token generated.
 3. Scroll to the top and tap on `Authorize`, paste the copied token and click Authorize.
 4. Next try out the POST `/products` to create a product.
 5. Similarly, you can check the other listed APIs

## Scripts
-  `dev` : Run the application in development mode
- `test`: Run the test cases
- `coverage`: Check the code coverage
- `report`: Generate the code coverage in html format(After running this script, open the file `coverage/index.html` in browser)
- `lint`: lint code
- `lint:fix`: Fix linting issue
- `prettier`: Run prettier code formatter
- `commit`: Create commit message

## Runing with Docker

####  Run in Docker
`docker-compose up`

> use -d flag to run in detached mode

#### Tear down
`docker-compose down`

#### To re-build
`docker-compose build`
