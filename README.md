# Node Js Project Structure

This project structure aims at structuring the code based on components. Each component has its own model, routes, controller, service and test.

# Followed best practices

- Async/Await Support
- Express Rate Limiter
- Validating schema using Joi
- Helmet to secure Express app
- Logging using Winston and Morgan
- Testing using Mocha
- ESLint
- Separate Express 'app' and 'server'
